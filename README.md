## 🚀 Deployment

- **Frontend:** Deployed as a static site on Render
- **Backend API:** Node.js + Express deployed on Render
- **Database:** PostgreSQL hosted on Render
- **Authentication:** JWT-based auth with protected routes

Environment variables are managed securely through Render.


## 📝 Notes

- The `entries` API maps to a `daily_entries` table in the database via a PostgreSQL view, allowing clean API naming while enforcing a one-entry-per-day constraint at the database level.

## Why this project exists

This project was built to practice and demonstrate:

    - Full-stack application architecture

    - Secure authentication flows

    - Relational database design

    - Real-world state management

    - Thoughtful UX decisions

    - Clean, maintainable code

Rather than focusing on complex features, the goal was to build something usable, calm, and intentional

## Future Improvements
- Prompt previews
- Mood trends over time
- Tagging reflections
- Exporting entries
